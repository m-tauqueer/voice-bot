# Engram member private memory — the leak was ours, and the fix already exists

Owner: Tauqueer. Status: **research redone 8 Sep 2026, fix shipped the same day.** The workaround this file used to recommend was **not needed**. Engram already supports per-member private memory for a backend serving many end users; we were not using the credential model it is built on. Each member now authenticates with their own session token, and per-subscriber isolation plus per-member private writes are live-verified. Rollout and what shipped: [ENGRAM_PRIVATE_ROLLOUT.md](ENGRAM_PRIVATE_ROLLOUT.md). Contract: [ENGRAM.md](ENGRAM.md) §2.3. Personas sittings: [PHASE_5_PLAN.md](PHASE_5_PLAN.md) §4.

This file is the evidence record. The operator tasks it describes in §10 are still open.

---

## 1. What happened in the product

Two Cognora Google accounts talked to the **same published persona** on voice/chat:

- `getcognora@gmail.com` said something like "my name is Harish."
- Later `tauqueer655@gmail.com` heard the bot treat that name as known.

App-side isolation was fine: different `users` rows, different Engram member ids, different Postgres sittings, subscribe per member. In Engram's dashboard **People → Private**, both members' turns showed under **one** subscriber:

`8de1b2b278724e0bba19000086f8bef2` = org admin `mohammadtuti655@gmail.com` — the account that owns our `egm_` API key.

That part of the original diagnosis was correct: **all bot traffic landed in the API key owner's private pool.**

---

## 2. The root cause we published, and why it was wrong

The earlier version of this file, and [ENGRAM_PRIVATE_ROLLOUT.md](ENGRAM_PRIVATE_ROLLOUT.md), concluded:

> `chat` / `retrieve` / `converse` take no `user_id`, therefore a multi-tenant backend **cannot** aim them at a member's pool. Engram must add a subject parameter before per-member private memory is possible.

The first half is a fact. **The second half does not follow, and it is wrong.**

Engram never intended a subject parameter. It resolves the member from the **authenticated principal**, and it expects a backend serving many end users to hold **one credential per end user** — which it will issue to us on demand. Its docs say so directly:

> "The backend derives these pools from **authenticated identity** and enforces them structurally through the core's tenant isolation." — [concepts/persona-memory](https://engram-docs-alpha.netlify.app/concepts/persona-memory)

> "A caller carries one of two bearer tokens; **both resolve to the same principal.** **Session** — a short-lived token for a signed-in person… **API key** — a long-lived `egm_` credential for a program." — [authentication](https://engram-docs-alpha.netlify.app/authentication)

> "**A session token works anywhere an API key does.**" — [quickstart](https://engram-docs-alpha.netlify.app/quickstart)

> "**add** — Add a person to the org… If it is a brand-new user, **supply a password so the account can be created.**" — [sdk/members](https://engram-docs-alpha.netlify.app/sdk/members)

> `session = engram.auth.login("alice@acme.com", "correct-horse-battery")` … `token = session["token"]` — [sdk/auth](https://engram-docs-alpha.netlify.app/sdk/auth)

So the missing piece was never on Engram's side. **We create each member's Engram account with a password and then delete the password** — `worker/src/worker/engram/org_member.py:124` mints it, `:138` clears it — and then talk to every persona as the key owner. The leak is a credential-model bug in our worker, not a gap in Engram's API.

The earlier file also listed "Password / `auth.login` per member" as an explicit non-goal, and [ENGRAM.md](ENGRAM.md) §2.3 asserted that a discarded member password "cannot act as a member on `chat`/`retrieve`." That assertion was never measured. It is false.

---

## 3. What we measured (8 Sep 2026, live alpha, org `100912164da2419885314c9fdb5358b7`)

Throwaway persona, throwaway member created with a password we kept, both destroyed afterwards.

### 3.1 A member session token authenticates the persona conversation routes

`auth.login(email, password)` returns a JWT plus its tenant:

```json
{"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9…", "token_type": "bearer", "expires_in": 43200,
 "user": {"id": "8f048d27df5d41e8b3f0b7f2c510194d", …}, "role": "member",
 "tenant": "100912164da2419885314c9fdb5358b7:8f048d27df5d41e8b3f0b7f2c510194d"}
```

Decoded claims carry `sub` / `user_id` = the member, `role: "member"`, `exp` = **12 hours** out.

Build a client on it — `EngramClient(org, member_id, api_key=token)` — and the conversation routes land where they should:

| Call as the member | `tenant` in the response |
| --- | --- |
| `personas.chat(pid, "…")` | `{org}:{persona}:8f048d27df5d41e8b3f0b7f2c510194d` |
| `personas.converse(pid, "…")` | `{org}:{persona}:8f048d27df5d41e8b3f0b7f2c510194d` |

`personas.retrieve(pid, "favourite colour")` as that member returned **both** pools, correctly labelled per row:

- `…:{persona}:8f048d27…` → `"Remember this: SESSIONPROBE-…-my-favourite-colour-is-vermilion"`
- `…:{persona}` → `"The probe persona … answers questions about colours."`

Semantic retrieve over the member's own private pool **works**. It was never broken; we were never the member.

### 3.2 Nothing landed in the admin pool

| Admin read | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `user_memories(pid, member)` | 4 rows — the marker, both persona replies, the converse turn |
| `user_memories(pid, admin)` | **`{"memories": []}`** |
| `personas.users(pid)` | `["8f048d27df5d41e8b3f0b7f2c510194d"]` — the member only |
| `conversations(pid, user_id=member)` | both threads, with turn counts |

### 3.3 A member token cannot overreach

| Attempt as the member | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `user_memories(pid, admin_id)` | `403 cannot access another user's private memory` |
| `private(pid, admin_id).text(…)` | `403 cannot access another user's private memory` |
| `scoped("{org}:{pid}:{member}").memory.list()` | `403 persona-private memory is not readable on the generic /t/{tenant} routes` |

Member permissions are exactly `["memory:read", "memory:write"]`. Defence in depth holds: even with a stolen member token, the blast radius is that one member's own pool.

### 3.4 The credential can only be set once — this is the real constraint

| Attempt (as org admin) | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `platform.set_password(member, new_pw)` | `403 missing permission(s): ['platform:admin']` |
| `members.add(same_email, password=new_pw)` | `409 user is already a member` — password unchanged |
| `auth.register(same_email, new_pw)` | `409 an account with this email already exists` |
| `auth.login(email, new_pw)` | `401 invalid email or password` |
| `auth.login(email, original_pw)` | still succeeds |
| `members.remove` then `members.add` with a new password | **same `user_id`**, private pool intact, **password still the original** |

Our org admin key holds `["billing:read","members:manage","members:read","memory:read","memory:write","metrics:read","org:manage","tokens:read"]`. It has **no** `platform:admin` and **no** `tokens:manage` (`tokens.create` → `403 missing permission(s): ['tokens:manage']`).

**Therefore: the password we set at `members.add` is the only credential we will ever have for that member.** Discard it and that member is unreachable for good — remove-and-re-add does not recover it, because the platform account outlives org membership.

### 3.5 What this means for the two accounts already on People

`getcognora@gmail.com` and `tauqueer655@gmail.com` were joined by `ensure_org_member`, which either succeeded with `password=""` (pre-existing Engram account) or retried with a random password it then cleared. Either way **we hold no credential for them and cannot mint one.** They have to be re-provisioned under an identity we control. Nothing is lost by that: their private pools are empty — every turn they ever took went to the admin's pool.

---

## 4. The fix

Per member, per persona turn:

1. **Provision once** — `members.add(email, role="member", password=<random>)`, and **keep** the password (encrypted at rest, never logged).
2. **Mint a session** — `auth.login(email, password)` → JWT, `expires_in` 43200s. Cache per member; refresh before expiry; re-login once on a `401`.
3. **Talk as the member** — `EngramClient(org, member_id, api_key=<session token>)` for `chat` / `converse` / `retrieve` **only**.
4. **Keep the org key for admin work** — `personas.create/teach/answer/pool(shared)`, `subscribe` / `unsubscribe`, `user_memories` / `forget_user_memory` on the delete-my-data path. A member token cannot do these and must not be asked to.
5. **Fail closed** — if login fails, fail the turn. Never fall back to the org key on a member path. That fallback *is* the leak.

What this buys over the withdrawn workaround: real semantic private retrieve, Engram-native compression and episodes, working `session_id` threads, `BRAIN_MODE=chat` becomes correct rather than forbidden, per-member rate-limit buckets instead of one shared one, and per-member usage metrics instead of everything billed to the admin.

Rollout is in [ENGRAM_PRIVATE_ROLLOUT.md](ENGRAM_PRIVATE_ROLLOUT.md).

---

## 5. Why not the old workaround #2

Kept here so nobody re-derives it. It was: write with `private(pid, user_id=member).text`, read with `user_memories`, filter `retrieve` to shared-only, ban `converse`/`chat` on member paths.

It works — those admin surfaces really do isolate — but it costs a semantic private retrieve, replaces conversation turns with flat ingest, adds an admin list call per turn, forbids `BRAIN_MODE=chat`, keeps every end user in one rate-limit bucket, and leaves all usage metered against the admin. It is a worse product built to route around a limit that is not there.

One correction to the old evidence, because it is going in a message to Engram: we reported that `retrieve` "does not see subject-ingest writes." It does. `retrieve` reads **the caller's** private pool, and the caller was the admin, so a write aimed at member A's pool was correctly invisible. The SDK says this outright — `personas.private` docstring: "Read it back with `retrieve`, which spans your private pool and the shared one." Do not send Engram the claim that their write path is unindexed.

---

## 6. What is still genuinely missing from Engram

Only one thing, and it is narrow:

**An org admin cannot obtain a credential for a member of their own org.** Password reset is `platform:admin` (superadmin), and `tokens.create` is org-scoped with no subject and needs `tokens:manage` we do not hold. So a backend must take custody of every member's password forever, and any member whose account it did not create is permanently unreachable.

The ask, in preference order:

1. **Org-admin-scoped session mint** — `POST /orgs/{org}/members/{user_id}/token` returning a short-lived session token for a member of that admin's own org. This removes password custody from integrators entirely and is the clean fix.
2. Failing that, **org-admin password reset** for a member of their own org (today `platform.set_password` needs `platform:admin`).
3. **Document the pattern.** [examples/support-copilot](https://engram-docs-alpha.netlify.app/examples/support-copilot) promises "per-member isolation, so one customer's conversation is invisible to another" while the sample program binds a single `ENGRAM_USER_ID`. Nothing on the site shows a server obtaining many member credentials. That gap is what cost us this incident.
4. **Doc bug:** [sdk/overview](https://engram-docs-alpha.netlify.app/sdk/overview) still shows `EngramClient(org_id, f"{persona_id}:{user_id}")` for persona-private addressing. [sdk/tenants](https://engram-docs-alpha.netlify.app/sdk/tenants) and `llms.txt` both say that is a guaranteed 403.

Not blockers. Item 1 is an improvement request; the product ships without it.

---

## 7. Defects on our side this exposed

These are ours, they are real today, and they are not fixed by switching credentials. Parts for each are in [ENGRAM_PRIVATE_ROLLOUT.md](ENGRAM_PRIVATE_ROLLOUT.md).

1. **The grounding path has no tenant filter; the display path does.** `worker/src/worker/turn/service.py:417-421` feeds every retrieve hit to the answer model. `:846` filters the memory panel with `is_own_private_pool`. The path that *speaks to the member* is the unfiltered one. That asymmetry is the mechanism by which "Harish" was spoken aloud.
2. **Leaked text was copied into our own Postgres and is re-served.** In retrieve mode `outcome.messages` *is* the retrieved memory text, and `insert_turn(..., messages=…)` (`turn/service.py:927`) plus `insert_memory_refs(...)` (`:936-941`) persist it. It comes back through session detail (`gateway/src/insights/queries.ts:580,589-595`) and through `/api/me/export` (`gateway/src/lifecycle/export.ts:97,140-144`). `wipeMemberRows` deletes by the *deleting* user's id, so member A's words inside member B's rows **survive A's delete-my-data**. An upstream leak became a first-party retention defect. Historical rows need purging, not just a forward fix.
3. **The filter does not defend against the key owner.** If the API key owner signs into Cognora, their `users.engram_user_id` becomes the admin People id, and `is_own_private_pool` returns true for the admin pool — which holds everyone's turns. The memory panel and export would render all members' conversations as that account's own.
4. **Probes write into the live persona's pool.** `worker/src/worker/engram/probe.py:44` chats to `ENGRAM_PERSONA_ID` (the real `7f5f6d3d…`), and `worker/src/worker/brain/probe.py:39` drives real turns through both brain modes. Those writes become grounding for real member turns.
5. **`_grant_tried` is never invalidated.** `turn/service.py:185`. After delete-my-data unsubscribes a member (`lifecycle/purge.py:96`), the cached pair suppresses re-subscribe until a worker restart.
6. **The client cache implies isolation it does not provide.** `registry.py` keys clients by member id, but every cached client carries the same key and therefore the same principal. Under the fix it becomes true; today it is decoration.
7. **The test asserted the wrong thing.** `worker/tests/test_engram.py:112-121` checks that a private tenant is *passed through*, never that it belongs to the caller. The gateway probe was fixed to assert the positive (`gateway/src/voice/isolationProbe.ts:443-459`) but it only guards the panel, not the turn.

---

## 8. Reproducing this

Both probes are throwaway-only: they create their own persona and member, and delete both in a `finally`. Neither touches a real persona or a real account.

- `session_probe.py` — provisions a member, logs in, talks as them, and asserts the pool ownership in §3.1–3.3.
- `session_probe2.py` — the credential-lifecycle matrix in §3.4.

They are not in the repo yet; a part in the rollout plan folds the first one into `worker/src/worker/engram/probe.py` so CI can assert member pool ownership on every run.

One question is still open because it needs a domain decision from Tauqueer: **can `members.add` take a service-controlled synthetic address** (e.g. `cognora-<app-user-id>@<a domain we own>`) instead of the member's Google address? Engram validated the address format — it rejected `@example.test` as reserved and accepted a `+tag` gmail alias — but we have not tested a domain we own. If it can, member provisioning never depends on an email whose account might already exist, and §6 item 1 stops mattering to us.

---

## 9. Out of scope here

- Implementing anything (wait for Tauqueer's go).
- One Engram org per Cognora user.
- Treating the Private-tab UI as an API.
- Migrating the admin pool's historical turns into member pools. They are mixed-owner by construction; they get deleted, not sorted.

---

## 10. Ops checklist — forget the admin private pool (run once)

The Postgres migration `infra/migrations/0013_clear_leaked_memory_text.sql` clears `memory_refs.memories_used` (to `[]`) and `turns.messages` (to NULL). That is our copy of the leak. **Engram still holds the mixed-owner product traffic in the API key owner's private pool.** Do not migrate those rows into member pools — they belong to no single member. Forget them.

This is an operator procedure, not a request path. There is no product button and no automatic mass-delete.

### Who and where

- Org / API key owner People id (measured): `8de1b2b278724e0bba19000086f8bef2` (`mohammadtuti655@gmail.com`). Confirm with `account.me()` if unsure.
- Personas that took real member traffic. The live member-facing persona in `.env` is `ENGRAM_PERSONA_ID`. Throwaway probe personas can be destroyed instead of forgotten.
- Org API key (workspace admin). A member token cannot read or forget another user's private pool.

### Option A — Engram dashboard

1. Open People → Private for each persona that took product traffic.
2. Select the **admin** subscriber, not a member.
3. Forget / delete the product-traffic rows. Do not copy them anywhere.

### Option B — API on the org key

Same surfaces delete-my-data already uses (`docs/ENGRAM.md` §2.3): `personas.user_memories(persona_id, admin_user_id)` then `personas.forget_user_memory(persona_id, admin_user_id, gid)` for each gid, paging until the list is empty. Then `personas.users(persona_id)` should no longer show leftover product-traffic under the admin id (the admin may still be listed as a subscriber).

Do **not** call `unsubscribe` on the org admin. Do **not** `members.remove` the org admin. Do **not** run this against a member People id — those pools are empty; every turn went to the admin.

Confirm: `user_memories(persona_id, admin_user_id)` returns `{"memories": []}` (or equivalent empty) for each persona that served members.

### Afterward

New member turns must not write this pool again (converse write-back is off until members authenticate as themselves). If new rows appear under the admin id after that, a write path is still open — stop and find it before another sitting.


---

## 11. Resolved: `turns.text` was redacted

Migration 0013 cleared `turns.messages` and `memory_refs.memories_used` — the retrieved memory blobs. It did **not** touch `turns.text`, which is the spoken transcript of the conversation. Some of those persona replies were composed from another member's private facts, so a name like "Harish" can still sit inside a different member's transcript.

**Decision taken:** wipe it. In production that is one member's personal data, retained in another member's exportable record, outliving an erasure request. We cannot tell which turns are contaminated, and after containment new turns are clean by construction.

Migration `infra/migrations/0015_redact_pre_containment_transcripts.sql` sets `turns.text` to `[redacted: recorded before private memory was isolated]` for every turn whose `created_at` is before `schema_migrations.applied_at` for `0013_clear_leaked_memory_text.sql`. `turns.text` is `NOT NULL`; the placeholder is obviously redacted so session detail, the owner conversation list, and `/api/me/export` still render. Re-running the migration does not touch later turns.

What is gone: the spoken wording of every pre-cutoff turn. What is not: later turns, audio blobs, session metadata, Engram pools.

---

## 12. Delete-my-data clears the Engram password we stored

Delete-my-data still purges Engram on the org key (`user_memories` + `forget_user_memory` + `unsubscribe`), then wipes our rows only if that purge reported clean.

It now also **nulls `users.engram_member_secret`** in the same transaction that deletes the user, and drops any in-memory session token on the worker. Engram cannot reissue that password. A returning Google account is joined again by email (`409 already a member`), we store the Engram id with a **null** secret, and they talk **shared-only forever**. That is a one-way door, not a bug.

Known stranded accounts that already have no recoverable password: `getcognora@gmail.com`, `tauqueer655@gmail.com`, `mohammadtuti655@gmail.com` (API key owner). They degrade the same way.

Proposed member-facing copy (not shipped — ask before changing a screen):

- Empty memory panel can stay `Nothing stored about you yet.` A degraded member's panel is empty; that sentence is still true.
- Delete confirmation should add: `Private memory cannot be restored afterwards. A later sign-in still works, but this persona will only use shared knowledge.`
