# Progress

Live status as of 18 Sep 2026. Owner: Tauqueer.

This file answers "where are we?" It is not the architecture spec
([`architecture.md`](architecture.md)), not the memory contract
([`architecture/memory.md`](architecture/memory.md)), and not a build list ([`plans/`](plans/)).
For behaviour, read the code.

## What this is

A browser voice bot that speaks as an owner-taught **persona** with long-term Engram memory. Members
sign in with Google (waitlist), pick a published persona, then talk at `/chat` or `/voice`. Private
memory is per (member, persona). Shared knowledge is per persona.

Speech today: Deepgram Voice Agent (Nova-3 STT + Aura-2 TTS) with our brain behind a BYO-LLM shim.
A persona whose provider is Fish and that has a Fish id uses Deepgram listen + hosted Fish TTS
instead; the brain is unchanged.

## What works

Typed chat, spoken calls, personal `/dashboard`, owner `/admin` (create/link, teach, ingest,
publish, unpublish, destroy), waitlist, daily quotas, consent/export/delete, public `/status`,
isolation probes. Personas are built end to end: pickers on `/chat`, `/voice`, `/dashboard`, with
sittings and memory pinned to the chosen persona.

Per-member Engram private memory works (8 Sep 2026): each member authenticates with their own
session token, so their turns land in their own private pool, and a member we cannot credential
degrades to shared-only rather than falling back to the key owner. That credential hole is three
accounts only — full list and why in [`architecture/memory.md`](architecture/memory.md) §11.

Private recall on the default brain was restored 9 Sep 2026 after Engram 0.5.0 made unscoped
retrieve shared-only: two parallel scoped reads labelled `persona_memories` / `caller_memories`, and
a private-only memory panel. A scope classifier can run beside those reads and drop the list that
does not bear on the question; it is off until `ENGRAM_SCOPE_ROUTER_ENABLED=true`.

Caller facts are extracted off the reply path and written as private text. Hang-up (End call, socket
close, End chat) fires a second extract over the finished sitting. The owner CLI can list and forget
one member's private pool for one persona without destroying shared knowledge.

History and measured latency: [`archive/shipped.md`](archive/shipped.md).

## In flight

**[`plans/voice-audio.md`](plans/voice-audio.md)** — the echo/routing trade and per-persona voice
configuration. Branch `frontend`.

The spoken call currently runs **half-duplex over the loudspeaker**: while the persona speaks the
member's microphone is not transmitted, and for 2500 ms afterwards it is still not transmitted.
Nobody can interrupt, and the first 2.5 s of every member reply is dropped.

That shape was not chosen — it fell out of turning echo cancellation off to get sound out of the
loudspeaker instead of the earpiece, and has been patched four times since. Phase 1 of the plan
measures both modes on a real device and locks the result in a decision record. Evidence:
[`reviews/voice-audio-2026-09-18.md`](reviews/voice-audio-2026-09-18.md).

Also in that plan: the Fish model is pinned globally to `s2.1-pro-free` with no per-persona or admin
control, and the Deepgram Aura voice is a free-text id box with no catalogue and no preview.

**[`plans/caller-memory.md`](plans/caller-memory.md)** — live `/chat` and `/voice` sittings for the
labelled lists, the classifier, and next-sitting caller-fact recall are still outstanding.

## Parked

Nothing in [`archive/`](archive/README.md) starts until Tauqueer names it into a plan. Cloned Fish
voices and the member card-grid UI are in [`archive/phase-6-plan.md`](archive/phase-6-plan.md);
parked product is in [`archive/future.md`](archive/future.md).

Deliberately off: blob audio archiving (`VOICE_AUDIO_PERSIST_ENABLED=false` until a storage account
is named) and `BRAIN_MODE=chat` (slow, kept as a switch; default `retrieve`). CI/CD, backups,
Key Vault, and security 2.0 are not in the current deploy — see [`ops/deploy.md`](ops/deploy.md).

Aura spoken calls need a live public worker URL (`BYO_LLM_PUBLIC_URL`). Fish sittings think at
`WORKER_URL` from the gateway. A Fish API key is not required to write tests; live Fish sittings
need `FISH_API_KEY`.

## Hard constraints

Do not re-decide these here. Full log: [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md).

- **Tauqueer names the part.** Never pick the next one. Never work two parts at once.
- Config, not magic values. No keyword or intent heuristics for language understanding.
- Never hand-build Engram tenant strings. Text-only into Engram. Audio — including clone clips —
  never goes to Engram.
- TTS routing is a dedicated provider key from env (`PERSONA_VOICE_PROVIDER_KEY`), not id-format
  sniffing and not "Fish key is nonempty." A Fish sitting with a missing key or a 401/402 fails
  closed, with no Aura fallback.
- Ground truth for behaviour is the code. Docs own intent.
