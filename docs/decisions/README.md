# Decisions

Architecture and product choices, one file each. Format: [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md). Process: [../README.md](../README.md).

Read this index before re-opening a choice. **Accepted** means Tauqueer locked it. Do not rewrite an Accepted body; supersede it with a new numbered file.

Current architecture (mutable “how”): [architecture.md](../architecture.md). Current snapshot: [progress.md](../progress.md).
